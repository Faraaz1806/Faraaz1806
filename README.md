Got it! Let’s make it **honest, clean, and focused on UI/UX, front-end, and problem-solving**, without overacting. Here’s a refined version:

# Assalamualaikum, I'm Mohammad Faraaz

I’m an aspiring **Front-End Developer & UI/UX Designer** currently pursuing my Bachelor's in IT.
I’m not an expert — just a learner who builds real things, experiments, makes mistakes, and keeps improving.

I believe in using technology to **solve problems** — whether it’s creating tools to make life easier, learning through practice, or improving processes.

## What I Actually Do

* I design **user-friendly interfaces** and build **functional front-end experiences**.
* I identify problems and try to **solve them using technology**, mainly for my learning and real practice.
* I collaborate on ideas to make them real — not perfect, but **functional and meaningful**.
* I learn at my own pace — mostly through **practice**, not just tutorials.

## Skills (Real & Developing)

* **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (basic)
* **UI/UX Design**: Figma, Canva, Branding
* **Backend & Databases**: Python (Flask), SQLite, MongoDB (basic understanding)
* **Tools**: GitHub, GitHub Desktop, VS Code
* **Also**: Video Editing, Design for Social Media

> I focus on learning by building and solving problems — not just following tutorials.

## Final Note

> “I’m not trying to be the best. I’m trying to be better than yesterday.”

Thanks for reading this far — I value **real effort over perfection**.

If you want, I can also make a **slightly shorter, punchy version** optimized for recruiters to read in under a minute — still honest but sharper.

Do you want me to do that?
