# Assalamualaikum, I'm Mohammad Faraaz

I’m an aspiring software developer from Surat, currently pursuing my Bachelor's in IT.  
Not an expert in Coding — just a learner who builds real things, makes mistakes, and keeps improving.

I believe in using technology for a **purpose** — whether it’s making education accessible, creating awareness, or building something that benefits others.

## What I Actually Do

-  I build simple but **purposeful projects** (like SmartExam for student assessment).
-  I manage **design and social media** for local brands and education platforms (Mindseeds, Decent).
-  I collaborate with friends to make ideas real — not perfect, but functional.
-  I’m learning at my own pace — mostly through **practice**, not just tutorials.



## Skills (Real & Developing)

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS (Basic)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), SQLite, MongoDB
- **Tools**: GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Figma, Canva, VS Code
- **Also**: Video Editing, Branding, Poster Design

> I don’t know everything — but what I do know, I actually use.

## Featured Projects

### [SmartExam](https://github.com/Faraaz1806/SmartExam)  
A digital exam management system we’re building as a team. Still in progress.  
I handled UI, database flow, and project structuring.

## Final Note
